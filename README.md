#Switcher⇌Roo

##What is this?

Switcher⇌Roo is app designed by Tyroo for her furry transformation themed art. It has sliders and options that are used to modify depicted characters body and/or personality aspects. Search for switcher-roo tag on e621 to get the idea.

##Key features

###CONTROL
CONTROL lets you connect to other user and change their app settings (manipulate sliders/checkboxes, create new sliders etc.). All changes will be reflected on their side in real-time!

###CharViz (beta)
Make your own character, dress them up in various outfits and adjust their body with sliders! Note: this feature is in beta and species support is a bit limited. Also it is disabled by default so you will need to enable it in options.

###Randomizer
You want to make a character and have a lack of inspiration? Don not hesistate to hit Randomizer button a few times! Works best with CharViz enabled.

##TODO/planned features

```html
I know the code is a mess, especially the parts written about 2 years ago, however I will refactor some stuff when I feel like it.
```

###Clean-up/refactoring:

- Redo menus that let users create custom species (also used for defining inanimate objects)
- loadPreviousState() function refactoring

###New features:
- Create up to 3 custom radio inputs
- Additional 5 custom sliders
