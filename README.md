# Switcher⇌Roo

## What is this?

Switcher⇌Roo is app designed by Tyroo for her furry transformation themed art. It has sliders and options that are used to modify depicted characters body and/or personality aspects. Search for switcher-roo tag on e621 to get the idea.

## Key features

### CONTROL
CONTROL lets you connect to other user and change their app settings (manipulate sliders/checkboxes, create new sliders etc.). All changes will be reflected on their side in real-time!

### CharViz (beta)
Make your own character, dress them up in various outfits and adjust their body with sliders! Note: this feature is in beta and species support is a bit limited. Also it is disabled by default so you will need to enable it in options.

### Randomizer
You want to make a character and have a lack of inspiration? Don't hesistate to hit Randomizer button a few times! Works best with CharViz enabled.
